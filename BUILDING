Unix, Linux or Mac OS X
=======================

To compile on a Unix system, use:

    % tools/build
    
This will generate class files in the src/ directory which you can run using:

    % cd src/
    % java main.java.main.java.balckjack.Blackjack

Also, a .jar file will be placed in bin/ that can be run independent of the location of the other source files. On Mac OS X, you can double click this file to run it. However, on some Unix systems, you can't and therefore will need to run it using the following:

    % cd bin/
    % java -jar main.java.main.java.balckjack.Blackjack.jar

Additionally, I've provided a 'clean' script for Unix that will remove all generated *.class and .jar files.

    % tools/clean
    
Windows XP
==========

On a Windows system, to build:

    % cd src
    % javac main.java.main.java.balckjack.Blackjack.java
    
To run the game;

    % java main.java.main.java.balckjack.Blackjack
